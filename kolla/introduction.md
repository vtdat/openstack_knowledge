# Kolla Introduction

Kolla’s mission is to provide production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating OpenStack clouds.

Kolla-Ansible is highly opinionated out of the box, but allows for complete customization. This permits operators with minimal experience to deploy OpenStack quickly and as experience grows modify the OpenStack configuration to suit the operator’s exact requirements.
